other info:

1. Create user works, it does crash when a new user is created but the user
does get saved into the DB.

2. Couldn't get the list of todo's to save into the database, although
when typed out, logged out of account, it is saved through the cookies i think?
You can log out and log back in, it remains but after restarting the node service
it doesn't get saved.

3. the links in the member sites bring up 404, although /todo works.
